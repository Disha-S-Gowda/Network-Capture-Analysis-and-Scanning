# Network Capture Analysis and Scanning

The "Network Capture, Analysis, and Scanning" project is a comprehensive exploration of various tools and techniques used in network security and traffic analysis. Through a series of immersive labs, the lab made me delve into the functionalities of tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) syntax, gaining hands-on experience in capturing, analyzing, and filtering network traffic.

Each lab focused on different aspects of network analysis, covering topics such as resolving ports, filtering SMTP and ICMP traffic, analyzing DNS requests, exploring HTTP content, and applying display filters in Wireshark. Additionally, labs also delve into tcpdump functionalities, including writing captured packets to files, listing available interfaces, displaying packet contents in ASCII and hex formats, and filtering packets based on IP addresses and ports.

Through these labs, I learnt essential skills such as interpreting packet details, extracting relevant information from network traffic, identifying potential security threats, and troubleshooting network issues. Furthermore, they gain insights into the importance of MD5 checksums in preserving the integrity of captured packet files and understand the significance of proper filtering techniques in network analysis.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in network traffic capture, analysis, and scanning, preparing them for real-world scenarios in cybersecurity where the ability to monitor, analyze, and secure network traffic is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of computer networks.
